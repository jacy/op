%% Theory

%% Heads-up play. The small blind is the button and acts first 
%% before the flop and last after the flop. The player 
%% who does not have the button is dealt the first card.

%% There are three players remaining and one is eliminated.
%% Determine which player would have been the next big blind 
%% ... that player becomes the big blind and the other player 
%% is the small blind (and button).

%% Small blind is eliminated. The player who was the big blind 
%% now posts the small blind and the player to his left 
%% posts the big blind. The button does not move and the player 
%% who was the button, will be the button once again.

%% Big blind is eliminated. The player to the left of the eliminated 
%% big blind now posts the big blind and there is no small blind 
%% for that hand. The button moves to the player who was the small blind. 
%% On the following hand, the button does not move and the two blinds 
%% are posted normally.
